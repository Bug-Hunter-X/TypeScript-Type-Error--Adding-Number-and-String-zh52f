# TypeScript Type Error: Adding Number and String

This example demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript that occurs when attempting to add a number and a string.  TypeScript's type system prevents this operation to maintain type safety.

The `bug.ts` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.ts` shows how to correct it.  The solution involves explicit type checking and conversion.
